# bookbot

Usage: python3 main.py <path_to_text>
Example: python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt

My bookbot does two things, packaged in an easy-to-read report:
1. Gives the total word count of the text document passed to it.
2. Gives an ordered breakdown of the most used to the least used letters in the text, along with counting how many times each letter appears.

Bookbot is my first project, based on the course at [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)!
